# free_text_search

Search a inverted positional index and return ranked references to documents relevant to the search phrase.

*THIS PACKAGE IS IN BETA DEVELOPMENT AND SUBJECT TO DAILY BREAKING CHANGES.*

## Objective

The compoments of this library:
* parse a free-text phrase to a query; 
* search the `dictionary` and `postings` of a text `index` for the query `terms`; 
* perform iterative scoring and ranking of the returned dictionary entries and postings; and 
* return ranked references to documents relevant to the search phrase.

## Definitions

The following definitions are used throughout the [documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/free_text_search/latest/):

* `corpus`- the collection of `documents` for which an `index` is maintained.
* `dictionary` - is a hash of `terms` (`vocabulary`) to the frequency of occurence in the `corpus` documents.
* `document` - a record in the `corpus`, that has a unique identifier (`docId`) in the `corpus`'s primary key and that contains one or more text fields that are indexed.
* `index` - an [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) used to look up `document` references from the `corpus` against a `vocabulary` of `terms`. The implementation in this package builds and maintains a positional inverted index, that also includes the positions of the indexed `term` in each `document`.
* `postings` - a separate index that records which `documents` the `vocabulary` occurs in. In this implementation we also record the positions of each `term` in the `text` to create a positional inverted `index`.
* `postings list` - a record of the positions of a `term` in a `document`. A position of a `term` refers to the index of the `term` in an array that contains all the `terms` in the `text`.
* `term` - a word or phrase that is indexed from the `corpus`. The `term` may differ from the actual word used in the corpus depending on the `tokenizer` used.
* `text` - the indexable content of a `document`.
* `token` - representation of a `term` in a text source returned by a `tokenizer`. The token may include information about the `term` such as its position(s) in the text or frequency of occurrence.
* `tokenizer` - a function that returns a collection of `token`s from `text`, after applying a character filter, `term` filter, [stemmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) and / or [lemmatizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation).
* `vocabulary` - the collection of `terms` indexed from the `corpus`.
