## Overview

The components of this library:
* parse a free-text phrase with [query modifiers](#querytermmodifier-enumeration) to a query; 
* search the `dictionary` and `postings` of a text `index` for the query [terms](#queryterm-class); 
* perform iterative scoring and ranking of the returned dictionary entries and postings; and 
* return ranked references to documents relevant to the search phrase.

Query phrases can include [modifiers](#query-modifiers) broadly consistent with Google search modifiers.

Refer to the [references](#references) to learn more about information retrieval systems and the theory behind this library.

## Usage

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your flutter project, add the `free_text_search` dependency.

```yaml
dependencies:
  free_text_search: <latest version>
```

In your code file add the `free_text_search` import.

```dart
import 'package:free_text_search/free_text_search.dart';
```

To parse a phrase simply pass it to the `QueryParser.parse` method, including any [modifiers](#querytermmodifier-enumeration) as shown  in the snippet below. 

```dart
// A phrase with all the modifiers
  const phrase =
      '"athletics track" +surfaced arena OR stadium "Launceston" -hobart NOT help-me';

  // Pass the phrase to a QueryParser instance parse method
  final queryTerms = await QueryParser().parse(phrase);

  // The following terms and their `[MODIFIER]` properties are returned
        // "athletics track" [EXACT] 
        // "athletics" [OR] 
        // "track" [OR] 
        // "surfaced" [IMPORTANT] 
        // "arena" [AND] 
        // "stadium" [OR] 
        // "Launceston" [EXACT] 
        // "launceston" [OR] 
        // "hobart" [NOT] 
        // "help-me" [NOT] 
        // "help" [NOT]     

```

The [examples](https://pub.dev/packages/free_text_search/example) demonstrate the use of the [QueryParser](#queryparser-class) and [PersistedIndexer](#persistedindexer-class).

## API

To maximise performance the API manipulates nested hashmaps of DART core types `int`, `double` and `String` rather than defining strongly typed object models. To improve code legibility and maintainability the API makes use of [type aliases](#type-aliases) throughout.

### Type Aliases

The following type definitions are defined in this library to complement the type definitions imported from the `text_analysis` and `text_indexing` packages.

* `ChampionList` is an alias for `Map<Term, List<Document>>`, a hashmap of `Term` to the list of `Document`s that contain that  term. The ordered set of `Document`s is in descending order of term frequency (`Ft`) and each document (`Document.docId`) can only occur once.;
* `ChampionListEntry` is an alias for `MapEntry<Term, List<Document>>`, an entry in a `ChampionList`;
* `` is an alias for ``, a ;

### FreeTextSearch class

The `FreeTextSearch` class exposes the `search` method that returns a list of [SearchResult](#searchresult-class) instances in descending order of relevance.

The length of the returned collection of [SearchResult](#searchresult-class) can be limited by passing a limit parameter to `search`. The default limit is 20.

After parsing the phrase to terms, the `Postings` and `Dictionary` for the query terms are asynchronously retrieved from the index:
* `FreeTextSearch.dictionaryLoader` retrieves `Dictionary`; 
* `FreeTextSearch.postingsLoader` retrieves `Postings`;
* `FreeTextSearch.configuration` is used to tokenize the query phrase (defaults to `English.configuration`); and
* provide a custom `tokenFilter` if you want to manipulate tokens or restrict tokenization to tokens that meet specific criteria (default is `TextAnalyzer.defaultTokenFilter`.
  
Ensure that the `FreeTextSearch.configuration` and `FreeTextSearch.tokenFilter` match the `TextAnalyzer` used to construct the index on the target collection that will be searched.

### SearchResult class  

 The `SearchResult` model represents a ranked search result of a query against a text index:
 * `SearchResult.docId` is the unique identifier of the document result in the corpus; and
 * `SearchResult.relevance` is the relevance score awarded to the document by the scoring and ranking  algorithm. Higher scores indicate increased relevance of the document.

### QueryParser class

The `QueryParser` parses free text queries, returning a collection of [QueryTerm](#queryterm-class) objects that enumerate each term and its [QueryTermModifier](#querytermmodifier-enumeration).

The `QueryParser.configuration` and `QueryParser.tokenFilter` should match the `TextAnalyzer`used to construct the index on the target collection that will be searched.

The `QueryParser.parse` method parses a phrase to a collection of [QueryTerm](#queryterm-class)s that includes:
* all the original words in the phrase, except query modifiers ('AND', 'OR', '"', '+', '-', 'NOT);
* derived versions of all words returned by the `QueryParser.configuration.termFilter`, including child words and stems or lemmas of exact phrases; and

A [QueryTerm](#queryterm-class) for a derived version of a term always has its `QueryTerm.modifier` property set to `QueryTermModifier.OR`, unless the term was marked `QueryTermModifier.NOT` in the query phrase.

### FreeTextQuery class

The `FreeTextQuery` enumerates the properties of a text search query:
* `FreeTextQuery.phrase` is the unmodified search phrase, including all modifiers and tokens; and
* `FreeTextQuery.terms` is the ordered list of all terms extracted from the `phrase` used to look up results in an inverted index.

### QueryTerm class

The `QueryTerm` object extends `Token`, and enumerates the properties of a term in a free text query phrase:
* `QueryTerm.term` is the term that will be looked up in the index;
* `QueryTerm.termPosition` is the zero-based position of the `term` in an ordered list of all the terms in the source text; and
* `FreeTextQuery.modifier` is the [QueryTermModifier](#querytermmodifier-enumeration) applied for this term. The default modifier` is `QueryTermModifier.AND`.

### QueryTermModifier Enumeration

The phrase can include the following modifiers to guide the the search results scoring/ranking algorithm:
* terms or phrases wrapped in double quotes will be marked `QueryTermModifier.EXACT` (e.g.`"athletics track"`);
* terms preceded by `"OR"` are marked `QueryTermModifier.OR` and are alternatives to the preceding term;
* terms preceded by `"NOT" or "-"` are marked `QueryTermModifier.NOT` to rank results lower if they include these terms; 
* terms following the plus sign `"+"` are marked `QueryTermModifier.IMPORTANT` to rank results that include these terms higher; and
* all other terms are marked as `QueryTermModifier.AND`.

## Definitions

The following definitions are used throughout the [documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/free_text_search/latest/):

* `corpus`- the collection of `documents` for which an `index` is maintained.
* `dictionary` - is a hash of `terms` (`vocabulary`) to the frequency of occurence in the `corpus` documents.
* `document` - a record in the `corpus`, that has a unique identifier (`docId`) in the `corpus`'s primary key and that contains one or more text fields that are indexed.
* `index` - an [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) used to look up `document` references from the `corpus` against a `vocabulary` of `terms`. The implementation in this library relies on a positional inverted index, that also includes the positions of the indexed `term` in each `document`.
* `index-elimination` - selecting a subset of the entries in an index where the `term` is in the collection of `terms` in a search phrase.
* `postings` - a separate index that records which `documents` the `vocabulary` occurs in. 
* `postings list` - a record of the positions of a `term` in a `document` and its fields. A position of a `term` refers to the index of the `term` in an array that contains all the `terms` in the `text`.
* `term` - a word or phrase that is indexed from the `corpus`. The `term` may differ from the actual word used in the corpus depending on the `tokenizer` used.
* `text` - the indexable content of a `document`.
* `token` - representation of a `term` in a text source returned by a `tokenizer`. The token may include information about the `term` such as its position(s) in the text or frequency of occurrence.
* `tokenizer` - a function that returns a collection of `token`s from `text`, after applying a character filter, `term` filter, [stemmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) and / or [lemmatizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation).
* `vocabulary` - the collection of `terms` indexed from the `corpus`.
